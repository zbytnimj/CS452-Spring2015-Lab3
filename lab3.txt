CS452/EE465 Computer Graphics Spring 2015
Lab #3

due: Monday, 3/2/15 at midnight

Write a WebGL application that will display, light, and rotate a 3D shape.

Create an interesting 3D object (other than a cube or a sphere). Your object should be in local coordinates, 
so you will need a ModelView matrix to transform into model then eye coordinates. It should be a color other 
than gray.

Add a light, and use the modified Phong lighting model to color your object.

The arrow keys will rotate the object as follows: left arrow - rotate counterclockwise about the Y axis; 
right arrow - rotate clockwise about the Y axis; up arrow - rotate counterclockwise about the X axis;
down arrow - rotate clockwise about the X axis.

Use a perspective projection matrix.

Requirements:
1. vertex coordinates are not in the default range - a (non identity) Model-View matrix is required.

2. use webgl-utils.js, initShaders.js and MV.js from Angel

3. three files are required in the solution: lab3.html, lab3.js and lab3.README.txt. The lab3.README.txt file
will contain your name and date along with a brief description of your solution. Note, however, that all
files should contain a comment including your name and date.

4. add a light, and use the modified Phong lighting model. It's your choice about whether to compute
the lighting in the vertex shader or the fragment shader

5. interact with your object with the arrow keys as described above.

6. use a perspective projection matrix (you determine the properties)
